# easyTypePassword
Firefox password generator extension based off the [famous xkcd password comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) Password that are easy to remember need to be easy to type, and passwords that are easy to type need to be secure. This password generation model does all this. This extension simply imports that generation into a simple button click.
